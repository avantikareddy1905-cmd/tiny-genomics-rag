{"id": "S1", "text": "Alzheimer’s disease is highly heritable, with estimates between 60% and 80%. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 20 risk loci, but these explain only part of the genetic variance."}
{"id": "S2", "text": "The APOE ε4 allele, defined by rs429358, is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, conferring a 3- to 15-fold increase in risk. The locus on chromosome 19 contains a complex linkage disequilibrium structure that contributes substantially to disease heritability."}
{"id": "S3", "text": "This meta-analysis combined data from 455,258 individuals, including clinically diagnosed and AD-by-proxy cases, and identified 29 genome-wide significant risk loci implicating 215 potential causal genes."}
{"id": "S4", "text": "Novel loci identified include ADAMTS4, HESX1, CLNK, CNTNAP2, ADAM10, APH1B, KAT8, ALPK2, and AC074212.3. Replication in the deCODE cohort supported several of these, particularly ADAM10 and APH1B."}
{"id": "S5", "text": "Functional annotation showed that most genome-wide significant SNPs are in non-coding regions enriched for chromatin activation marks such as H3K27ac and super enhancers, indicating transcriptional regulation roles."}
{"id": "S6", "text": "The strongest deleterious coding variants were found in TREM2 (rs75932628), TOMM40 (rs142412517), and APOE (rs7412). The APOE ε2 allele appears protective against Alzheimer’s disease."}
{"id": "S7", "text": "Gene mapping and chromatin interaction analyses implicated immune-related genes expressed in spleen, liver, and microglia. CLU and PTK2B may interact physically and contribute to AD pathogenesis through shared biological mechanisms."}
{"id": "S8", "text": "Gene-set analysis highlighted pathways related to lipid metabolism and amyloid precursor protein processing. The 'Protein lipid complex' and 'Regulation of amyloid precursor protein catabolic process' pathways were significantly enriched for AD-associated genes."}
{"id": "S9", "text": "Cross-trait genetic analyses suggested protective causal effects of cognitive ability and educational attainment on Alzheimer’s risk, with no substantial pleiotropy detected."}
